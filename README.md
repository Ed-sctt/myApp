MyApp

This file is meant to give some guidance on how to run the app. 

CAUTIOUS! The app is composed of two entities. Please read the README.md file in " MyappR2 " branch or check the this link : https://ed-sctt.github.io/myApp/index.html in order to use MyAppR package in R. 

I am assuming you have downloaded the repository and you set the right path.

step 1 : 

Edit the file Shopify_api.js and replace the token with your own that you can get here : https://developer.spotify.com/

step 2 :
```shell 
  # run command in TERMINAL or shell
  # Connection to the local server 
  npx nodemon DB.js
```

Open your browser, and enter the local host address " localhost::2445 ". You are good to go.
